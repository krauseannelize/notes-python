# 2. Setting up Python

## <span style="color: teal">Installation</span>

### Linux

Python 3 should be installed by default. You can check to see if Python is installed by typing `python3` in the terminal. This will:

- return the version number, and
- launch an interactive Python shell - use `exit()` to close.

In the event that you do need to install Python 3 on Linux, you can use the command `sudo apt install python3`.
