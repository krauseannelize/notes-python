## Installation

### *Installing Python on Linux*

Python 3 should be installed by default. You can check to see if Python is installed by typing `python3` in the terminal. This will:

- return the version number, and
- launch an interactive Python shell - use `exit()` to close.

In the event that you do need to install Python 3 on Linux, you can use the command `sudo apt install python3`.

## IDEs and Text Editors

### *VS Code*

VS Code is a versatile and powerful code editor that is designed to support a wide range of programming languages with built in support for Git version control.

sudo snap install vscode   # use Snap to install VS Code
```

Alternatively, download the appropriate package for your Linux distribution from the official [VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Install the package in a terminal by running the following command: `sudo dpkg -i vscode.deb` - replace *vscode.deb* with the actual filename.
